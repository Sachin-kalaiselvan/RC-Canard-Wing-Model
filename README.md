# RC-Canard-Wing-Model
# Demonstration and Wind Tunnel Testing of Remote-Controlled Canard Wing Aircraft Model


This project involves the design, fabrication, and testing of a remote-controlled canard wing aircraft model. The primary aim is to demonstrate the operation of the aircraft and determine pressure and attitude differences during flight using wind tunnel testing.


# Key Features:

* Design: Utilized CATIA V5 for designing the canard wing with NACA 2412 airfoil.
* Fabrication: Employed 3D printing techniques and materials such as ABS and Styrofoam.
* Testing: Conducted wind tunnel tests to analyze pressure distribution and flow characteristics.
* Results: Achieved higher angles of attack with improved maneuvering capabilities and minimized flow separation.

# Technologies and Tools:

* CATIA V5
* XFLR5 for airfoil performance comparison
* 3D Printing (FDM method)
* Arduino for sensor integration
* Wind tunnel for testing
